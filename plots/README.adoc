== Prerequisites

Install JWPLOT: https://github.com/jmjwozniak/jwplot

== Plots

All plots make an EPS and a PDF by default.
This can be changed in plot.sh .

To make the plots, do:

=== Load plot
----
$ json2table load /path/to/nt3_mlrMBO-360-10 load.data
$ ./plot.sh load
----

=== Rate plot
----
$ json2table rate /path/to/nt3_mlrMBO-360-10 rate.data
$ ./plot.sh rate
----

The learning rate is:
----
training_size = 1120
trainable_params * ceiling(training_size/batch_size) * epochs / total time
----
meaning something like "weight updates per second."

=== Loss plot

This is the ML validation loss over time.
NaNs are automatically excised from the data.

----
$ json2table loss /path/to/nt3_mlrMBO-360-10 loss-raw.data
$ ./monotone loss-raw.data loss.data
$ ./plot.sh loss
----

The +monotone+ script ensures that the values in +loss.data+ are decreasing
over time.

== Logging

We use conventional Python logging.
The log level and configuration are in plottools.py
